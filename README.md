Let X=G/B be the flag variety of a semisimple complex Lie group G, B being a fixed Borel subgroup. 
We are interested in the description of the GIT-classes of ample line bundles on X w.r.t. a given reductive subgroup. 
More specifically, we are interested in extremal values of the codimensions of unstable loci.

This script computes the extremal values for codimensions of unstable loci for one-paramater subgroups.
The one-parameter subgroups we have implemented here are:
- fundamental coweights
- the sum of the fundamental weights (or one half times the sum of the positive roots)
